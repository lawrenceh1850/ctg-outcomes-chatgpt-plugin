    "description_for_model": "You are given a few data fields for a specific clinical trial. These criteria contain a title of the trial, a description of the study, a list of conditions (which are supposed to be but may not be the main diseases that are being studied, sometimes the entered data doesn't indicate the exact condition being studied), and primary and secondary outcomes that are being studied. Your task is to parse this information line by line and phrase by phrase, identifying all relevant medical keywords and terms associated with the study. Return a CSV output. The first column should contain the NCTID provided. The next column should include the title of the study. The next column should contain the main Disease or Condition (extract the primary disease or condition without including detailed definitions or descriptions). The next column should include a one line summary of the outcomes being studied by the trial (this should be some kind of quantifiable result eg bone density of wrist after X months). Remember the output should be in CSV format.",
